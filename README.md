# -Reinforcement-Learning-for-Trading

Summary of the project:

The project aims to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to perform trading using the Gym environment. It utilizes the "gym-anytrading" library, which extends the OpenAI Gym library with functionality for trading environments. The RL agent is implemented using the A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) algorithm from the "stable-baselines3" library.

The project follows the following steps:

Importing Dependencies: Importing the required libraries and packages, including Gym, gym-anytrading, stable-baselines3, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

Data Loading and Preparation: The project loads the stock market data from a CSV file and preprocesses it by converting the Date column to DateTime type and setting it as the index.

Creating and Running the Trading Environment: The Gym environment is created using the "stocks-v0" environment from gym-anytrading. The environment is initialized with the preprocessed stock data, and a random agent is used to perform actions in the environment. The results are stored for analysis.

Analyzing Agent's Performance: The project prints and plots the rewards obtained by the agent at each step of the trading process.

Training the RL Agent: The project sets up the environment for training the RL agent. It uses the A2C algorithm with the 'MlpPolicy' and trains the agent for a fixed number of timesteps.

Testing the Trained Agent: The trained RL agent is used to perform trading in the environment, and the results are stored for analysis.

Analyzing Trained Agent's Performance: The project prints and plots the rewards obtained by the trained agent at each step of the trading process.

Overall, the project demonstrates the process of training an RL agent to perform trading tasks using the Gym environment and A2C algorithm.
